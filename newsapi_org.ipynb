      "Title: Gadkari Proposes AI for Road Safety, But Past Trials Raise Concerns\n",
      "Source: MediaNama.com\n",
      "Fetching full article content...\n",
      "Content: MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India Nitin Gadkari, Minister of Road Transport and Highways proposed the need to improve road safety through the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI). He made this proposal during his address at the 12th Edition of the Traffic InfraTech Expo. According to the press release, India experiences around 5 lakh accidents each year. Many of these fatalities occur among individuals aged 18 to 36. Additionally, Gadkari noted that road accidents cause an estimated economic loss of 3% of the country’s GDP.  To tackle this issue, Gadkari expressed interest in collaborating with Indian startups to integrate advanced engineering solutions and promote the adoption of AI in road safety initiatives.  He also announced the government’s decision to appoint experts from the private sector to collaborate in developing technological solutions. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari launched the “iRASTE” project, an AI-powered initiative, on a pilot basis, aimed at reducing road accidents by 50% in Nagpur, Maharashtra. iRASTE focuses on vehicle safety, mobility analysis, and road infrastructure safety to move towards a “Vision Zero” accident scenario, reported India Today. The initiative will equip municipal vehicles with collision avoidance technology, potentially reducing accidents and near misses by up to 60%. It will conduct studies to recommend engineering fixes for accident-prone areas (black spots). Moreover, an AI system will monitor road infrastructure continuously. The Safe Kerala Project is a road safety initiative in Kerala that aims to reduce traffic violations and road accidents. The project uses 726 AI cameras to detect traffic violations. The cameras analyze videos and images to enforce penalties. These cameras mainly identify traffic violations, including riding a two-wheeler without a helmet, not wearing a seatbelt, exceeding the passenger limit on two-wheelers, using mobile phones while driving, and running red lights.  In June 2023, officials implemented AI cameras. Reportedly, within the first 12 hours of operation, the cameras recorded 38,520 violations. The first month’s results were promising, with AI cameras reporting over 2 million traffic violations and authorities issuing 128,740 challans. However, several cases emerged of AI cameras wrongly identifying traffic violations.  For instance, a biker received a challan for overspeeding and the speed mentioned was 1240 km/h. In other instances, AI cameras penalised drivers for not wearing seat belts because they couldn’t detect them due to their beards or dark clothing. The Kerala govt entered into a partnership with Keltron, a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) to implement the AI camera system.  However, The Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation (Keltron) is facing scrutiny due to allegations of overpricing its AI surveillance project for roads in Kerala and subcontracting the work to unqualified private entities.  From the 726 AI cameras installed across the state, fines collected over the course of a year amounted to Rs. 365 crore, reported in May this year.   In April this year, reports indicated that Keltron had halted the issuance of challans. According to the contract with the government, Keltron had to issue 25 lakh fine challans for one year. However, they ceased issuing challans after traffic violations surpassed 50 lakhs. Despite the halt in issuing challans, the AI cameras continue to operate throughout the state. This year, Bengaluru was reported as the most congested city in India by TomTom Traffic Index. It reported a congestion level of 63% in Bengaluru and the average citizen lost 132 hrs a year due to traffic. Subsequently, Bangalore police brought in AI systems to ease traffic congestion and manage traffic violations.  However, in March this year, it was reported that AI traffic cameras failed the accuracy test. The camera installed under the Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) had detected only a 75% to 80% accuracy in catching non-helmet rule violations. A realisation that prompted the Bengaluru Traffic police to manually recheck all violations to weed out the errors flagged by the system.  Both Kerala and Karnataka’s instances highlight the limitations of automated enforcement. Despite this, many states have started to integrate AI into their traffic management systems.  Currently, ITMS monitors more than 7,500 traffic lanes.

      "                         The Maharashtra government has initiated the distribution of subsidies for cotton and soyabean producers for the 2023 kharif season.  The initiative was launched online during the State cabinet meeting by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, along with Deputy Chief Ministers Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar. The government has announced a subsidy of ₹5,000 per hectare for cotton and soyabean farmers, with a limit of up to two hectares per farmer.  This move aims to provide much-needed financial relief to farmers grappling with rising input costs and unpredictable weather patterns. In the first phase, ₹2,398.93 crore are being deposited into the accounts of 49.5 lakh registered farmers. Maharashtra has approximately 96,787 cotton and soybean farmers. Of these, data for 68,06,923 farmers has been uploaded on the government’s portal, enabling the disbursement process. Under the Namo Shetkari Mahasamman Scheme, 41,50,696 accounts have completed 70 per cent Aadhaar verification, while 4,60,730 accounts are still undergoing Aadhaar verification. An additional 17,53,130 accounts have been updated with Aadhaar consent forms. With the first phase of financial assistance reaching 63.64 lakh accounts of 49.5 lakh farmers, the state government has allocated ₹2,398.93 crores to ensure timely relief. “This step is expected to provide a significant boost to cotton and soyabean farmers, helping them navigate through the challenges of the ongoing season” said Chief Minister Shinde. \n",
